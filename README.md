## **üèóÔ∏è Project Overview**

* This project is part of the Break Through Tech AI Program, focused on equitable AI in dermatology.
* The challenge requires us to develop an AI model that can classify 21 different skin conditions from images while ensuring fair performance across different skin tones.
* Many dermatology AI models underperform on darker skin tones due to lack of diverse training data. This can lead to diagnostic disparities, misdiagnoses, and healthcare inequality. Our model aims to mitigate this issue by incorporating fairness techniques in training.

## **üìä Data Exploration**

Dataset Used
* Kaggle's competition dataset, containing 21 classes of skin conditions.
* Images labeled according to different dermatological diseases.


Data Preprocessing & Challenge
* Resized images to 224x224 pixels for model compatibility.
* Applied augmentations (random contrast, brightness adjustments, rotation, and flipping) to reduce bias.
* Balanced dataset using class weighting and a weighted sampler to prevent underrepresentation.
